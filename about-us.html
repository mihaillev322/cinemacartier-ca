<h1>About Civic Pantry Index and Our US-Focused Method</h1>

<section id="mission" class="content-section">
<h2>Mission and audience</h2>
<p>Civic Pantry Index exists to reduce uncertainty for people seeking food assistance in the United States. We recognize that navigating the landscape of food pantries, government programs, and community resources can be confusing and stressful, especially during times of financial hardship. Our mission is to provide clear, accurate, and nonpartisan information that helps you prepare before visiting a food pantry or applying for assistance.</p>
<p>Our primary audience includes US households experiencing food insecurity, whether due to job loss, medical expenses, fixed incomes, or other circumstances that strain household budgets. We also serve caregivers helping family members or neighbors access food resources, as well as caseworkers, social service professionals, and community volunteers who assist others in finding food assistance.</p>
<p>The problems we aim to solve are practical ones. Many people feel uncertain about what to expect when visiting a food pantry for the first time. They may not know what documents to bring, whether they qualify for assistance, or how to find pantries in their area. This uncertainty can create barriers that prevent people from accessing help they need and deserve.</p>
<p>By providing structured guidance on how food pantries typically operate, what documents are commonly required, and how to verify information with official sources, we help reduce these barriers. Our goal is to make the process of seeking food assistance less intimidating and more efficient.</p>
<p>It is important to understand the scope and limitations of this site. Civic Pantry Index provides informational guidance only. We are not a government agency and cannot process applications for SNAP, WIC, or other federal programs. We are not a legal services provider and cannot offer advice on immigration status, benefits eligibility disputes, or other legal matters. We are not a food pantry ourselves and do not distribute food directly.</p>
<p>Our information is intended to complement, not replace, direct communication with local food assistance providers. Because policies vary significantly by state, county, and individual organization, the guidance here represents general patterns rather than universal rules. Always verify specific requirements with your local pantry or benefits office before making decisions based on our content.</p>
<p>We maintain a nonpartisan stance on policy matters. Our focus is on helping people understand and access existing resources, not advocating for particular policy positions. We believe that accurate information empowers individuals to make their own informed decisions.</p>

<section id="methodology" class="content-section">
<h2>Methodology: how we evaluate sources</h2>
<p>The quality of our guidance depends on the quality of our sources. We follow a systematic approach to identifying, evaluating, and citing information about food assistance programs and practices.</p>
<p>Our source preference hierarchy prioritizes official and authoritative sources. Government websites with .gov domains receive highest priority because they provide primary information about federal and state programs directly from administering agencies. These sources include the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, state human services departments, and USA.gov.</p>
<p>Established nonprofit organizations with .org domains rank second in our hierarchy. Organizations like Feeding America maintain extensive networks of food banks and pantries, and their resources reflect practical experience serving millions of Americans. We prioritize nonprofits with transparent governance, established track records, and clear editorial standards.</p>
<p>University and educational institution websites with .edu domains provide valuable research-based information, particularly regarding nutrition education, community food security studies, and extension program resources. These sources help us understand broader context and evidence-based practices.</p>
<p>Major news organizations with strong editorial standards help us track policy changes, emergency distributions, and evolving practices. We use news sources primarily for context and current events rather than as primary sources for program rules.</p>
<p>We avoid sources that lack clear authorship, have obvious commercial bias, or make claims without supporting evidence. We do not cite social media posts, anonymous forums, or websites with unclear funding or governance.</p>
<p>Our update approach involves regularly reviewing key sources for policy changes, particularly around federal budget cycles, seasonal variations, and emergency declarations that affect food assistance availability. We note when information was last verified and encourage readers to confirm current details directly with providers.</p>

<p>By maintaining consistent source standards, we aim to provide information you can trust when making decisions about food assistance. We encourage you to explore our cited sources directly and verify current details with local providers.</p>
</section>

<section id="editorial-standards" class="content-section">
<h2>Editorial standards and corrections</h2>
<p>Our editorial approach emphasizes neutrality, clarity, and accessibility. We strive to present information without judgment or stigma, recognizing that food insecurity affects people from all backgrounds and circumstances. Seeking food assistance is a practical response to challenging situations, not a personal failing.</p>
<p>We write in plain language, avoiding jargon and bureaucratic terminology whenever possible. When technical terms are necessary, we provide clear definitions. Our goal is to make information accessible to readers with varying levels of familiarity with social services and government programs.</p>
<p>Accessibility extends to our website design. We use semantic HTML structure, maintain sufficient color contrast, and ensure our content works with screen readers and other assistive technologies. We avoid requiring JavaScript for core functionality.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that errors can occur despite our best efforts. If you identify inaccurate information on our site, we encourage you to verify with official sources first, then contact your local food assistance provider for current details. For corrections to our content, please reach out through your local provider or community organization, as we do not maintain direct contact forms on this site.</p>
<p>Our content is reviewed periodically to ensure accuracy, but we cannot guarantee real-time updates to reflect every policy change. The date of last review is noted where applicable, and we encourage readers to verify time-sensitive information directly with providers.</p>
</section>

<section id="blockquote" class="content-section">
<h2>Transparency note</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Local pantry rules can change quickly. We prioritize official and network sources, but the pantry itself is the final authority for requirements and hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This principle guides all our content. While we work to provide accurate general guidance, the specific food pantry or program you contact will always have the most current and applicable information for your situation. We encourage you to use our resources as a starting point for preparation, then verify details directly before visiting.</p>
